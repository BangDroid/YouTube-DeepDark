# YouTube-DeepDark
Videos should only be watched in the dark. May the dark show your way. (YouTube dark theme)

This is a dark theme for YouTube inspired by [FT DeepDark](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ft-deepdark/?src=search).

Also, credit where credit is due for the color palettes down bellow. ([@KDE](https://github.com/KDE), [@horst3180](https://github.com/horst3180), [@linuxmint](https://github.com/linuxmint), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/))

You can install the .js version for the classic style from [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/25333-youtube-deepdark).

Theme as a userstyle [here](https://userstyles.org/styles/135831/youtube-deepdark).

YouTube+ settings page (I cannot change the color of the text in that button because YouTube+ has !important in the css. Also the way the button is "checked" is from your operating system theme and not from YouTube itself)
