# YouTube-DeepDark
Videos should only be watched in the dark. May the dark show your way. (YouTube dark theme)

This is a dark theme for YouTube inspired by FT DeepDark https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ft-deepdark/?src=search

You can install it from here https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/25333-youtube-deepdark

Themes as Stylish styles here https://userstyles.org/users/377182
For the stylish version I added change color option.

YouTube+ settings page (I cannot change the color of the text in that button because YouTube+ has !important in the css. Also the way the button is "checked" is from your operating system theme and not from YouTube itself)
